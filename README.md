CTFs results Context Information Security

A lesson for you 'Recruitment guy'.

My CTFs results: ctf.ctx.is

Done them all except Rfid and Forensic2 (didn't have time), under 5/7 hrs as total time while doing other stuff.

I was rejected because I submitted my results with only the flags while they wanted a report [showcases your written communication and presentation skills], like you know.. I went to University to play football.

I was not told to submit my results in that format, so I wonder how many valid pentesters they let walk away.

Anyway I am publishing the flags because as I waste my time, somebody at Context Information Security will have to waste his/her time redoing the CTFs, they look up for me, I did not. "My time is precious Not like yours".
